# Carbonide
A distributed build system.

This project will feature mutliple build systems using the duktape scripting engine.
The idea is that there are way too many ways to build something correctly,  
and we definitly do not want to reinvent the wheel, enforce one thing (like CMAKE) or 
support everything by our own. 

The project started out as a distributed build system for linux packages, that were built
for ARM processors on multiple machines at the same time. But it only ran on linux, was
very restrictive, only worked for PKGBUILD files and it was poorly designed at that time, as it grew
too fast out of hand.
This is our try to create it anew, but better and far slimmer.


The project just started out, so please be patient and stay tuned for updates.
